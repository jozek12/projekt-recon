🔧 Project Plan: Movie Recommender System
✅ Step 1: Choose Dataset

Start with a broad dataset first. You can always filter for anime later.

    Option A (best starter): MovieLens dataset

        100k or 1M ratings, includes movie titles, genres, and user ratings

        Simple structure, good for collaborative filtering

    Option B: IMDb or TMDB + anime filtering

        Needs more cleaning and merging

        Great for anime-only version, but more complex

✅ Step 2: Choose Recommender Type

Let’s keep it beginner-friendly:
Type	Description	Good For Beginners?
Content-Based Filtering	Recommends similar movies based on genre, description, etc.	✅ Yes
Collaborative Filtering	Recommends based on similar users' ratings	✅ Yes, with built-in tools
Hybrid	Mix of both	Later!

Start with content-based or item-based collaborative filtering using scikit-learn.
✅ Step 3: Basic Project Features

    Input: a movie title (e.g., “Spirited Away” or “The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf”)

    Output: top 5–10 similar movies

    Filters: genre (optional), minimum rating, release year

✅ Step 4: (Optional) Anime Mode

Once the base system works:

    Filter your dataset to include only anime movies (via genre tags or custom list)

    Bonus: allow the user to toggle "anime only" on/off

    Use anime-specific tags from TMDB or AniList APIs later
Let’s make the decision tree simple:
⬜ MovieLens base project
⬜ Anime-only mode later
⬜ You pick the input (e.g., “I liked X”)
